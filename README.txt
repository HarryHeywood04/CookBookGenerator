I like cooking, I also like having all my recipes in the same format but typing out recipes and formatting them to all
be the same is a pain, so I made this. The aim of this project is to be able to feed it recipes in an XML format and the
program will then produce a printable document (html) with all the recipes in the form of a cookbook/recipe book.

To use this cook book generator put all recipes and images in the content folder, they can be in subdirectories.
If you don't have an image to go with the recipe, just don't define a image in the XML file. The output file is in the
output folder. You can open the html in any browser and then send it to print. It should be formatted properly at that
point.
